# Introduction to DevOps: Automate Everything to Focus on What Really Matters

This repository contains some code and files that I have created for various projects. Below you will find information on how to use some of the tools and software that I have used in this repository.

## Go Hugo Quickstart
**Hugo** is a static site generator written in Go. It's a popular tool for creating fast and flexible websites. To get started with Hugo, follow these steps:

1. Install Hugo by following the instructions on the **Hugo website**.
2. Create a new site by running the command **hugo new site mysite**.
3. Choose a theme from the **Hugo Themes website** or create your own.
4. Start the server by running the command **hugo server -D**.
5. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:1313  to see your new site.

## Git SCM Book
**Git** is a popular version control system used by software developers to manage their source code. The Git SCM Book is a comprehensive guide to Git that covers everything from basic commands to advanced workflows. To get started with Git, follow these steps:

1. Install Git by following the instructions on the Git website.
2. Create a new repository by running the command git init.
3. Add files to the repository using the git add command.
4. Commit changes to the repository using the git commit command.
5. Push changes to a remote repository using the git push command.

## GNU Make Docs
**GNU Make** is a build automation tool used to compile code and create executables. The **GNU Make Docs** provide a comprehensive guide to using Make for various tasks. To get started with Make, follow these steps:

1. Install Make by following the instructions for your operating system on the GNU Make website.
2. Create a Makefile in your project directory that specifies the build process for your project.
3. Run the make command to execute the build process specified in your Makefile.

## Installing & Using Themes
If you are using a tool or platform that allows you to customize the look and feel of your website, you may want to install and use a pre-built theme. Here are some general steps for installing and using a theme:

1. Download the theme files from the theme's website or repository.
2. Copy the theme files to the appropriate directory in your project.
3. Follow the instructions provided by the theme's author for configuring the theme and its options.
4. Preview your website to see the new theme in action.

## Add a help target to a Makefile
Makefiles can contain a help target that provides information about the available Make targets and their usage. Here's an example of how to add a help target to a Makefile:
```make
.PHONY: help

help:
    @echo "Available targets:"
    @echo "  help - Display this help message"
    @echo "  build - Build the project"
    @echo "  clean - Clean up temporary files"
```
In this example, running make help will display a message listing the available Make targets and their usage. You can customize this message to provide more detailed information about the targets in your Makefile. The @echo command is used to print the message to the console, and the .PHONY directive tells Make that "help" is not a file target, but rather a target that should always be executed when it is called.
